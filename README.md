# frog platformer
This is a C# game that can be run in Unity.

## Instructions
You are a frog! Your goal is to collect all of the fruit and reach the cup at the end of the screen. Collecting fruit will increase your score – you can do this by touching the fruit. To win, you must collect all of the fruit onscreen before you reach the cup. But be careful! There are spikes throughout the course, and if you touch them, you will lose!

Player controls
- Left key: Move left
- Right key: Move right
- Up key (or spacebar): Jump

Win/Lose conditions
- Win: collect all fruit on the screen, then touch the final cup
- Lose: touch a spike

Onscreen objects
- Platforms (grass, stone, floating sticks): these function as ground surfaces for the player to move on – the player can walk on them and jump onto them.- Moving rock platform: this platform moves up and down repeatedly, and the player should be able to jump onto it and be transported vertically by it.
- Frog (player): this is the player’s avatar – it can move left, right, and upwards (jump) according to the player’s controls.
- Fruit: when the player contacts the fruit, the score increases – collecting all of the fruit will allow the player to win the game.
- Spikes: when the player contacts the spikes, they lose and the game should stop.
- Starting flag: marks the start of the game – purely decorative, and the player can also stand on the platform.
- Final cup: when the player contacts the cup and has collected all of the fruit onscreen, the player wins and the game should stop – note this does NOT happen if the player touches the cup before collecting all of the fruit.
- Scoreboard: displays the number of fruits the player has collected so far.

Setup note: Be sure to use Full HD when viewing!
